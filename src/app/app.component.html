<!-- Form tag but need to inport form module in module.ts -->
<!--
  #newUserForm=”ngForm”: Angular automatically attaches an ngForm directive 
  to HTML form elements, but with this,
  we give our form a template reference name to make it easy to access its value and validity. 

  (ngSubmit) - is the function which will be called when submit button is clicked.

  [(ngModel)]=”userName”. This effectively creates two-way data binding, so if you change 
  the value of a property in the component class the change will be reflected in the template.

   #someName=”ngModel” syntax. We can then use these references to access the value or validity 
   of these fields.
   note: dont use same name for [(ngModel)] and #refrence variable. HTML will throw error.
   cannot reference..

   Each form field that has an ngModel directive should also have a name attribute set and that’s 
   the name that Angular will use internally for the form’s model representation. 
   The value for name doesn’t have to be the same as the value bound in the component 
   class using [(ngModel)].
